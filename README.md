RDF Modelling and Instance Language (RMIL)
====

A simple syntax for describing RDF data models in an entity centric way. The syntactic structures can be parsed to generate RDF triples and constraint structures. The constraint structure models are defined in the RDF Constraint Language (RDFCL). RDFCL is defined at http://github.com/SesamResearch/rdfcl.
